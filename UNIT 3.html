    <h1><strong><u> What is CSS?</u></strong></h1>
    <ul><li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS allows for the separation of content and presentation, enabling the definition of layout, colors, fonts, and other visual characteristics of a web page. It is designed to improve content accessibility, provide flexibility in specifying presentation characteristics, and enable the sharing of formatting across multiple web pages. CSS can define various typographic characteristics, layout, and non-visual styles, and it plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing and responsive web pages</li></ul>
    <strong><u><h1> History of CSS</h1></u></strong>
	<ul><li> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, first emerged in the early 1990s as a solution to the growing complexity of web design. The web was initially text-based, and HTML was the primary tool for structuring web documents. However, as the demand for more visually appealing websites grew, the need for a dedicated styling language became apparent. CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994, while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. It was not the only styling language in development at the time, but its cascading and developing sequence set it apart from the rest. The first version of CSS was invented in 1996, and CSS 2 was released in 1998, with work on CSS 3 beginning at that time. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, as it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules, each dealing with a relatively small subset of the overall specification and either adding new features or refining and extending existing features.</li></ul>
	<strong><h1><u>Versions of CSS</u></h1></strong>
	<ul><li> The versions of CSS are as follows:<br>

<strong>(1).<u> CSS1</u>:</strong> This was the first version of CSS, officially released in 1996. It included properties for adding font properties, text attributes, and backgrounds. However, it faced a lack of dependable web browser support initially.<br>

<strong>(2). <u>CSS2</u>:</strong> The CSS2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in 1998. It added properties for positioning, allowed CSS to be used for page layout, and introduced styles for other media types.<br>

<strong>(3). <u>CSS3</u>:</strong> CSS3, the latest version, was introduced with the earliest drafts published in 1999. It adds presentation-style properties, allowing for the effective building of presentations from web documents. CSS3 is divided into several separate documents called modules.<br>

Additionally, there is also CSS 2.1, which is a revision of CSS2. It fixes errors in CSS2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features, and adds already implemented browser features. CSS 2.1 went through a process of becoming a Candidate Recommendation and addressing problems with the patchy adoption of CSS and errata in the original specification.</li></ul>
<strong><h1><u> Browser support</u></h1></strong>
<ul><li> The browser support for various web technologies and features can be checked using different resources. One such resource is "Can I use" (caniuse.com), which provides support tables for HTML5, CSS3, and other web technologies. Additionally, Google provides information on supported browsers for signing in and using its services, emphasizing the importance of using a supported browser and enabling JavaScript for security reasons. Furthermore, developers can find information on supported browsers and platforms for Google sign-in and other features on the Google Developers website. For specific web technologies like CSS, the W3Schools website offers a CSS Browser Support Reference, detailing the support for CSS properties in different browsers. Moreover, Mozilla's Developer Network (MDN) provides information on browser support for various JavaScript APIs. These resources can help developers ensure the compatibility of their web content and applications across different browsers and platforms.</li></ul>
<strong><u><h1> What's new in CSS3</h1></u></strong>
<ul><li> CSS3, the latest version of CSS, introduced several new features to enhance the styling and design of websites. Some of the key features include:<strong>

(1). Advanced Animations and Transitions
(2). Multiple Backgrounds & Gradients
(3). Multiple Column Layouts
(4). Opacity
(5). Rounded Corners
(6). Flexbox
(7). CSS Grids
(8). Embedded Fonts
(9). Responsive Web Design
(10). Box Shadows</strong><br>

These features have enabled web developers to create more aesthetically pleasing and responsive websites with less code, making the styling process more efficient and effective.

For a comprehensive list of CSS properties and their support in different browsers, developers can refer to the CSS Browser Support Reference on the W3Schools website.

Additionally, CSS3 continues to evolve, with new features such as individual transform properties and the :not() pseudo-class being introduced in 2023.

Overall, CSS3 has significantly improved the capabilities of web styling, allowing for more creativity and flexibility in design and layout.</li></ul>

<strong><h1><u>CSS vs CSS3</u></h1></strong>
<ul><li> CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. On the other hand, CSS3 is the latest version of CSS, introducing several new features and enhancements to the styling capabilities of web pages.<br>

Some of the key differences between CSS and CSS3 include:<br>
- CSS provides basic styling properties such as color, layout, background, font, and border, while CSS3 introduces advanced features like animations, transitions, multiple backgrounds, gradients, and 3D transformations.<br>
- CSS3 supports responsive design, while CSS does not.<br>
- CSS3 can be broken down into modules, allowing for more modular and efficient development, whereas CSS cannot be split into modules.<br>
- CSS3 is faster than CSS and offers a wider range of color options, including HSL, RGBA, and gradient colors.<br>

In summary, CSS3 is an enhanced and more advanced version of CSS, offering a wider range of styling capabilities and improved efficiency for web development.</li></ul>

<strong><u><h1> Types of CSS</h1></u></strong>
<ul><li> There are three types of CSS: <strong>(1)Inline CSS (2) Internal or Embedded CSS (3) External CSS.</strong><br> (1). Inline CSS is a method of styling where CSS properties are directly applied to HTML elements within the same line of code.<br> (2). Internal or Embedded CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element, and is used to define a style for a single HTML page.<br> (3). External CSS is defined in a separate file and is used to define the style for multiple HTML pages. CSS3 is the latest version of CSS and introduced several new features and enhancements to the styling capabilities of web pages, including advanced animations and transitions, multiple backgrounds and gradients, multiple column layouts, opacity, rounded corners, flexbox, CSS grids, embedded fonts, responsive web design, and box shadows.</li></ul>

<strong><u><h1> How to use in html document? </h1></u></strong>
<ul><li>To use CSS in an HTML document, you can employ <strong>inline, internal, or external CSS.</strong><br>

<strong>-Inline CSS:</strong> To apply a unique style to a single HTML element, use the style attribute of the HTML element. For example, `&lt;h1 style="color:blue;"&gt;A Blue Heading&lt;/h1&gt;` applies a blue color to the heading.<br>

<strong>- Internal CSS:</strong> Define a style for a single HTML page within the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML page, using the &lt;style&gt; element. For instance, 
html
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    body {
      background-color: linen;
    }
    h1 {
      color: maroon;
      margin-left: 40px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

defines the background color and heading style for the page.<br>

<strong>-External CSS:</strong> Create a separate CSS file containing style properties and link it to the HTML document using a link tag within the &lt;head&gt; section. For example,
html
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

links the HTML document to an external CSS file named "styles.css".

These methods provide flexibility in styling HTML documents, allowing for unique styles, consistent styles across multiple pages, and easier maintenance of the code.



 
 <strong><u><h1> CSS Selectors and Their Types</h1></u></strong>
<ul><li>CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. There are several types of CSS selectors, each serving a different purpose. The most common types include:<br>

<strong>(1). <u> Element Type Selectors:</u></strong> These select elements based on their element name. For example, to select all paragraphs, the selector would be `p`.<br>

<strong>(2). <u> ID Selectors: </u></strong> They select a specific element based on its unique ID attribute. The selector is preceded by a hash symbol (#). For example, to select an element with the ID "myElement", the selector would be `#myElement`.<br>

<strong>(3). <u> Class Selectors: </u></strong> These select elements based on their class attribute. The selector is preceded by a period (.). For example, to select all elements with the class "myClass", the selector would be `.myClass`.<br>

<strong>(4). <u> Universal Selector:</u></strong> It selects all HTML elements on the page. The selector is an asterisk (*).<br>

<strong>(5). <u> Attribute Selectors:</u></strong> These select elements based on their attribute or attribute value. For example, to select all elements with a specific attribute, the selector would be `[attribute]`.<br>

<strong>(6). <u> Pseudo-Class Selectors:</u></strong> They select elements based on a certain state, such as when a user hovers over an element or when it's the first child of its parent.<br>

<strong>(7). <u> Pseudo-Element Selectors:</U></strong> These select and style a part of an element, such as the first line of a paragraph or the first letter of a heading.<br>

These are just a few examples of the many CSS selectors available, each offering a different way to target and style HTML elements.</li></ul>
