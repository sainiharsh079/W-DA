<h2>1.HTML</h2>
<P>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML is a fundamental building block of the World Wide Web and is essential for creating and designing web documents.

In HTML, documents are structured using a system of elements represented by tags. These elements define the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, forms, and more. HTML provides a way to organize information and present it on the internet in a standardized format.

HTML documents are composed of a hierarchy of nested elements, and each element has a specific purpose in defining the content and structure of a webpage. The use of HTML is often complemented by other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

</h2><strong>2.EVOLUTION OF HTML</strong></h2>
<P>
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. The evolution of HTML has gone through several versions, each introducing new features, elements, and improvements. Here is a brief overview of the key milestones in the evolution of HTML:

HTML 1.0 (1991):

The first version of HTML was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.
It included basic elements for structuring a document, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
The syntax was simple, and there were only 18 tags.
HTML 2.0 (1995):

Published as an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard in 1995.
Added features like forms, tables, and text alignment.
The first version to support scripts and applets.
HTML 3.2 (1997):

Introduced in 1997 as a W3C Recommendation.
Included support for scripting languages like JavaScript.
Added new elements like <&LT>div<&GT>, <LT>span<GT>, and introduced support for styles through the <&LT>style<&GT> element.
HTML 4.0 (1997-1999):

Released as a W3C Recommendation in 1997, with HTML 4.01 released in 1999.
Added support for scripting languages, applets, and introduced the concept of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling.
Included the Document Object Model (DOM) to allow scripts to manipulate the content of a document dynamically.
Introduced multimedia elements like <&LT>embed<&GT> and <&LT>object<&GT>.
XHTML (Extensible HTML) 1.0 (2000):

An XML-based version of HTML, designed to be more extensible and compatible with XML tools.
Encouraged stricter adherence to XML syntax rules.
XHTML 1.1 was released in 2001.
HTML5 (2014):

A major revision of HTML that brought many new features and improvements.
Introduced new semantic elements like article, section, nav, header, footer, etc.
Added native support for audio and video embedding (audio and video).
Introduced the <&LT>canvas<&GT> element for 2D drawing and the <&LT>svg<&GT> element for vector graphics.
Provided enhanced support for forms, including new input types.
Emphasized native support for multimedia, eliminating the need for plugins like Flash in many cases.
HTML Living Standard (Ongoing):

<h2> 4. HTML4 VS HTML5</h2>
<p>  HTML4 and HTML5 are two different versions of the Hypertext Markup Language, each with its own set of features and improvements. Here are some key differences between HTML4 and HTML5:

<ol>1.Doctype Declaration: HTML4: Requires a Document Type Definition (DTD) declaration at the beginning of the document.<br>
                           HTML5: Simplified the doctype declaration, and it is now just <!DOCTYPE html>.</ol>
                         
<ol>2.Syntax:<br> HTML4: Follows a more rigid and less semantic structure.<br>
              HTML5: Introduces new semantic elements, such as header, nav, section, article, footer, and others, making the markup more expressive and meaningful.</ol>

<ol>3.Multimedia:HTML4: Relies on third-party plugins (like Adobe Flash) for multimedia content.<br>
                 HTML5: Includes native support for audio and video elements, eliminating the need for external plugins. This enhances compatibility and performance.</ol>

<ol>4.Graphics:HTML4: Uses div and span elements with CSS for layout and styling. Graphics are typically handled with external technologies like Flash or images.<br>
               HTML5: Introduces the canvas element, allowing for dynamic rendering of graphics directly in the browser.</ol>

<ol>5.Forms:HTML4: Limited form validation, and developers often relied on JavaScript for client-side validation.<br>
            HTML5: Enhances form capabilities with new input types (e.g., email, url, date, etc.), native form validation, and the <datalist> element for providing predefined options.</ol>

<ol>6.Offline and Storage:HTML4: Lacks built-in support for offline web applications.<br>
                          HTML5: Introduces the Application Cache (AppCache) and Local Storage, enabling developers to create offline web applications and store data on the client-side.</ol>

<ol>7.APIs: HTML4: Relies heavily on JavaScript and external libraries for dynamic web applications.<br>
            HTML5: Introduces new JavaScript APIs, such as the Geolocation API, WebSockets, Web Workers, and more, providing enhanced functionality for modern web applications.</ol>

<ol>8.Backward Compatibility:HTML4: Older browsers may have limited support for newer features.<br>
                             HTML5: Designed with backward compatibility in mind, with browsers implementing support for new features gradually. Features can be used alongside existing       HTML4 elements.<br>
                       HTML5 represents a significant leap forward in terms of features, semantics, and support for multimedia. It is widely adopted and recommended for modern web development. However, it's essential to consider browser compatibility and use feature detection or polyfills when necessary for older browsers.</ol></p>

<OL>Document Structure:

HTML5 allows for more flexible document structures, accommodating various practices from earlier HTML versions. Older elements like font, center, and others may still work, though newer, more semantic alternatives are encouraged.</OL>
<OL>Parsing Rules:

HTML5 parsers are designed to handle markup from older HTML versions, ensuring that older web pages remain functional when rendered in modern browsers.</OL>
<OL>Deprecation Rather Than Removal:

Instead of outright removing elements or attributes, HTML specifications often deprecate them, signaling that they may be obsolete in the future but can still be used. This helps maintain compatibility with existing content.</OL>
<OL>DOCTYPE Declaration:

Including a proper Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE) at the beginning of an HTML document triggers standards mode in browsers, ensuring that rendering follows the specified standards. This helps maintain compatibility with older HTML versions.</OL>
<OL>Quirks Mode:

Browsers have different rendering modes, including quirks mode, which emulates older, less strict rendering behavior. This is activated when a web page lacks a DOCTYPE or contains certain deprecated features.</OL>
<OL>Global Attributes:

HTML5 introduced a set of global attributes that can be applied to most elements. While these are encouraged for consistency, older attributes from previous HTML versions are often still supported.</OL>
<OL>Browser Rendering Tolerance:

Modern browsers are designed to be tolerant of errors and inconsistencies in HTML markup. This tolerance helps maintain compatibility with older web pages that might not strictly adhere to the latest standards.</OL>
<OL>CSS Styling:

HTML5 works seamlessly with both old and new CSS styles. Browsers are generally backward compatible with CSS rules, allowing older styling methods to continue functioning.</OL>
